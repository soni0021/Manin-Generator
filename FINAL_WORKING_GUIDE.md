cd "/Users/manishsoni/Manin Animations"
python run_streamlit.py
# Opens at: http://localhost:8501
```

### Step 2: Generate Animation
1. **Enter your topic** in the text area:
   - Example: "Explain force in physics with visual examples"
   - Example: "Show water molecule structure with bonds"
   - Example: "Demonstrate photosynthesis process"

2. **Click "Generate Animation"** - AI creates:
   - 📋 Learning objectives
   - 🎨 Visual design plan
   - 🎬 Detailed storyboard  
   - 🗣️ Hinglish narration script
   - 💻 Production-ready Python code

### Step 3: Render Video
1. **Click "Render Video"** button
2. **Wait 1-3 minutes** for rendering
3. **Watch progress** in real-time with detailed logs
4. **View your video** directly in the browser
5. **Download** both video (MP4) and source code

## 🎯 **Best Topics to Try:**

### Physics
- "Explain Newton's second law with force and mass examples"
- "Show how electromagnetic fields work with charges"
- "Demonstrate wave properties like frequency and amplitude"

### Chemistry  
- "Show water molecule H2O structure with bond angles"
- "Explain ionic vs covalent bonding with electrons"
- "Demonstrate periodic table trends"

### Biology
- "Show cell membrane structure and transport"
- "Explain photosynthesis with light and dark reactions"
- "Demonstrate DNA structure and replication"

## 📊 **What You Get:**

### Generated Content
1. **Learning Objectives** - Clear educational goals
2. **Visual Design Plan** - Professional color scheme and layout
3. **Detailed Storyboard** - Beat-by-beat breakdown with timing
4. **Hinglish Narration** - Natural Hindi-English mixed script
5. **Production Code** - Clean, structured Python with perfect sync

### Video Output
- **Quality**: 720p30 (medium quality for speed)
- **Format**: MP4 with synchronized Hinglish audio
- **Duration**: Typically 30-90 seconds
- **Audio**: gTTS Hindi with natural pronunciation
- **Visuals**: Professional animations with no collisions

## 🛠 **Technical Details:**

### Video Generation Process
1. **AI Generation**: Gemini 2.5 Pro creates structured content
2. **Code Execution**: Manim renders the generated Python code
3. **Audio Synthesis**: gTTS creates Hinglish voiceover
4. **Synchronization**: Perfect timing via `tracker.duration`
5. **File Management**: Automatic cleanup and organized storage

### Quality Features
- ✅ **No element collisions** - Proper spatial organization
- ✅ **Professional colors** - BLUE, GREEN, ORANGE palette
- ✅ **Perfect audio sync** - Every animation matches voiceover duration
- ✅ **Clean code structure** - Modular, readable Python
- ✅ **Error handling** - Detailed debugging and fallback options

## 🎬 **Sample Output:**

When you enter "Explain force in physics", you get:

**Learning Objectives:**
- Define force as push or pull
- Show force effects on objects
- Demonstrate F=ma relationship

**Visual Design:**
- Primary: BLUE for main elements
- Secondary: GREEN for positive concepts
- Accent: ORANGE for emphasis
- Clean layout with proper spacing

**Generated Video:**
- Professional animation with synchronized Hinglish narration
- "Namaskar! Aaj hum force ke baare mein sikhenge..."
- Visual demonstrations with arrows, objects, and equations
- Perfect timing and smooth transitions

## 🎉 **Success Confirmation:**

✅ **Test Results**: Video generation test passed
✅ **File Size**: ~150KB (valid video file)
✅ **Format**: MP4 with audio track
✅ **Quality**: 720p30 resolution
✅ **Audio**: Clear Hinglish narration
✅ **Sync**: Perfect audio-visual timing
