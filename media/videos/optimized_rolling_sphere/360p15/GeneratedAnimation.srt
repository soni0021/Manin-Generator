Namaskar! Aaj hum ek complex physics problem dekhenge

2
00:00:04,264 --> 00:00:08,108
- rotating platform par rolling sphere ka motion.

3
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:13,295
Sphere par constant horizontal force F lagaaya jaata

4
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:16,630
hai. Platform freely rotate kar sakta hai.

5
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:20,257
Ab top view mein dekhte hain kya hota hai.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,427
Platform aur sphere ka top view. Orange

7
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:26,636
sphere blue platform par roll karta hai.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,373
Jab force lagti hai, sphere roll karta hai aur

9
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:36,444
platform opposite direction mein rotate hota hai. Action-reaction principle!

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,231
Dekho kitna beautiful pattern banta hai! Sphere

11
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,724
ka relative motion cycloid curve banata hai.

12
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:49,384
Is complex motion mein energy conservation, angular momentum, rolling

13
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:54,350
constraint, aur action-reaction - sab concepts involved hain.

14
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:12,486
Is tarah complex physics problems ko visual animation

15
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:15,982
se samajhna asan ho jaata hai. Thank you!
