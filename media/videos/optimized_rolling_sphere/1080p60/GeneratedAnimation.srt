Namaskar! Aaj hum ek complex physics problem dekhenge

2
00:00:04,264 --> 00:00:08,108
- rotating platform par rolling sphere ka motion.

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:13,245
Sphere par constant horizontal force F lagaaya jaata

4
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:16,580
hai. Platform freely rotate kar sakta hai.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,207
Ab top view mein dekhte hain kya hota hai.

6
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:23,344
Platform aur sphere ka top view. Orange

7
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:26,552
sphere blue platform par roll karta hai.

8
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:30,240
Jab force lagti hai, sphere roll karta hai aur

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:36,310
platform opposite direction mein rotate hota hai. Action-reaction principle!

10
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:40,064
Dekho kitna beautiful pattern banta hai! Sphere

11
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:43,557
ka relative motion cycloid curve banata hai.

12
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:49,184
Is complex motion mein energy conservation, angular momentum, rolling

13
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:54,150
constraint, aur action-reaction - sab concepts involved hain.

14
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:01,686
Is tarah complex physics problems ko visual animation

15
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:05,182
se samajhna asan ho jaata hai. Thank you!
