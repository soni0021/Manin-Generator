Hello! Today we will understand Le Chatelier's principle and see

2
00:00:04,762 --> 00:00:09,500
what effect increasing pressure has on this chemical equilibrium.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,653
Here we have a container with reactants and products in

4
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:19,958
equilibrium. Notice that the reactant side has 3 moles of

5
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:22,828
gas, and the product side has 2 moles.

6
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:26,654
Now imagine we double the pressure on this system.

7
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:30,705
When we do this, the container's volume becomes half.

8
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:37,659
When volume decreases, the concentration of each gas increases. Therefore,

9
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:43,552
the concentration of all reactants and products will immediately increase.

10
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:47,534
According to this, Option A is absolutely correct.

11
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:53,067
However, Le Chatelier's principle states that the system will oppose this

12
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:58,500
change. To reduce pressure, equilibrium will shift in the direction where

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,041
there are fewer gas moles, that is, in the forward direction.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,614
One very important point: the equilibrium constant 'K'

15
00:01:09,714 --> 00:01:14,630
only changes with temperature, not with pressure. Therefore,

16
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,556
options C and D are directly wrong.

17
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:22,424
So both A and B are sort of correct, but the first

18
00:01:22,524 --> 00:01:28,414
and most direct result of increasing pressure is the increase in concentration.

19
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:34,329
The shift happens afterwards. Therefore, Option A is the most accurate answer.

20
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:38,422
I hope you have understood this concept. Thank you!
