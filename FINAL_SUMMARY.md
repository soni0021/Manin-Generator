- **Storyboard**: Title → Equation → Visual demo → Real examples → Conclusion
- **Narration**: "Namaskar! Aaj hum Newton ke second law ke baare mein sikhenge..."
- **Code**: Complete Manim scene with synchronized voiceover

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Examples
Edit `streamlit_app.py`:
```python
example_topics = {
    "Your Topic": "Detailed description..."
}
```

### Changing AI Model
Update in `streamlit_app.py`:
```python
self.model = genai.GenerativeModel('models/your-preferred-model')
```

### Adjusting Render Quality
Modify in `run_animation()`:
```python
cmd = ["manim", str(temp_file), scene_name, "-qh"]  # High quality
```

## 🎓 Educational Impact

### For Teachers
- **Quick Content**: Generate animations in minutes
- **Curriculum Aligned**: Physics, Chemistry, Biology topics
